1) finish bug fixes, find where the data is wrong and email Subra
2) exception handling: create a log, make all the methods add to the log somehow, create a list of all potential exceptions and handle them in the log. 
   after a user executes main.py, they should have a log for each user.
3) make a function that creates a txt file for the bill and outputs it.
4) Better fix for monthly billing
5) add bill to bill table; for this (and bill output), it could help to create a bill class
6) modularization
